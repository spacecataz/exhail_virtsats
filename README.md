# exhail_virtsats
Create and analyze virtual satellite fly-throughs of BATS-R-US results for the ExHAIL Small Explorer (SMEX) proposal

The two main tools for accomplishing this are the `ExHail.py` python module and
the executable `sat_analysis.py` script.

Sample data files for testing analysis can be found in the `sample_data`
folder. Publication and analysis-critical scripts for bulk processing can
be found in the `analysis scripts folder`.
